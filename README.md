# System Design from Figma to React
Building a Design System, from Figma to React.

## Step 1 - Visual Structure of the Design System
In a first step, the following will be created: the visual basis of the Design System in Figma; which tokens will be used; and the components that will be part of the library in React.

The Figma Design File can be see [here](https://www.figma.com/files/project/69739439/Ignite-Lab---Design-System?fuid=939177568472572855)

## Step 2 - From Figma to React: creating the application
In this step we will export the Figma tokens and components to the code creating the React project base and documentation using Storybook.

Every token created in Figma is added to the TailwindCSS theme:
